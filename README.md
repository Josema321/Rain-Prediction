This project was done as a part of the Honors portion of the IBM Machine Learning Course on Coursera

For this project I used a rainfall dataset from Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology, cleaned the data, and applied different classification algorithm on the data.
I used classification algorithms to create a model based on the training data and evaluated the testing data using various evaluation metrics.

Algorithms such as: Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, SVM.

And I evaluate the model using: Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, R2-Score, Accuracy Score, Jaccard Index, F1-Score, LogLoss.
